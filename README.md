# Java-RMI-Auction-Project
An auction system involving client, server, server replica and client proxy elements. 

This project involved building a RMI server and client system from scratch. Using resgistry/RMI functions to create instances of servers for clients to interact with. Asynchronous replicas updated on every valid transaction in the server, with backup replicas taking over primary in case of failure. Token validation also implemented in earlier implementations to show knowledge of security practices.
